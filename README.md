# React Editor Kit (currently in alpha)

A suite of plugins for composing react-based text editors. Editor Kit is built using [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/) (v0.50+) - the fantastic editor framework for React. 

[LIVE EXAMPLES](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-editor-kit-examples-0e31g?file=/src/KitchenSinkEditor.tsx)

**PLEASE NOTE** This project is not quite ready to be released yet. I am using it for my current employer and also in a side project (Journal) but don't currently have time to make it fit for public consumption or write high-quality docs. 

The codebase should serve as a decent example of how to make use of the new Slate API for anyone working with Slate .50+. 

## Install

`npm i @mpkelly/react-editor-kit`

Take a look at the Codesandbox examples above and browse the source code for a better idea of how it works. 

Test.
